# General
This is a small application for monitoring the clipboard. The GUI in app.py creates a Tkinter text field. The text field updates with each new value from the clipboard.
The values are also stored in a database located in the same folder.
Additionally, there is a CLI with mcb.py. The CLI allows you to search the database.
